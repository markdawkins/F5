1. Establish a Session and Access the Shell
bash
# 1. SSH to the BIG-IP as admin
ssh admin@<f5_mgmt_ip>

# 2. Enter the TMSH shell and become root
tmsh
run util bash
# -OR- from the admin CLI directly:
bash
su -
2. Locate and Backup the Management SSHD Config
The management interface uses a separate sshd process and configuration file.

bash
# The config file is located at:
cd /etc/sshd

# Make a backup of the original config
cp sshd_config sshd_config.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
3. Edit the SSH Configuration File
Use a text editor like vi to modify the sshd_config file.

bash
vi /etc/sshd/sshd_config
4. Modify the Ciphers Line
Find the line that starts with Ciphers. It might be commented out (#Ciphers...) or already active.

To specify a custom list: Replace or add the line with your desired, space-separated list of ciphers. Always include a known, strong cipher that your SSH client uses.

Example (Restrict to strong, modern ciphers):

bash
Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
To see the default list: If the line is commented out, you can uncomment it and modify it. The system will use its internal defaults if the line is absent or commented.

Common, secure ciphers to use:

aes256-gcm@openssh.com

aes128-gcm@openssh.com

aes256-ctr

aes192-ctr

aes128-ctr

chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com

Insecure ciphers to remove (examples):

aes256-cbc

aes128-cbc

3des-cbc

Any cipher ending in -cbc

5. Save the File and Restart the Management SSHD Service
After saving the file in vi (:wq), you must restart the management sshd service for the changes to take effect.

bash
# Restart the management sshd service
systemctl restart sshd.service
